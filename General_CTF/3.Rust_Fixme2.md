Same as [Rust fixme3](/General_CTF/2.Rust_Fixme3.md) . here we just need to  find out the pass by reference was currently referenced or not! that's it...

how to solve!? here it is: 

First do same as `Rust-fixme3` . then open the `main.rs` file and look at the string ref as `&string` . here just add &mut after the string as shows `&mut string` . then go to end of the code as line `34` . Here look string is without `mut(mutable)` reference . add `&mut string `  . Done 

Now run the file and you got it....
