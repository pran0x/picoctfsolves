Another Rust program ctf. its very easy and simple.. all though if you stuck , here it the solve

- First open the `main.rs` file. if you don't know how to open then first solve previous 2 `rust fixme3 & rust fixme2` . 
- After open the `main.rs` file check the comments , you need to fix 3 thing 
    - end of the program or in  short missing `semicolon (;)` 
    - look at the return , its ret . replace it with `return.` 
    - and the end, look at the `println!()` function. here on the function `":?"`. replace it with `"{:?}"`. Ref : [why we use "{:?}"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#:~:text=Note%20that%20a,%22%7Br3%7D%22%29%3B)
    - run the file and it's done.
