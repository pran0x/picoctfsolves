This is kind of tricky. so first we need to download the file represent as `flag.c` from the `source ` 

- here you need to know what it Little Endian and Big Endian. Basically it just converted the `text to Hexadecimal format`.
- Here I use Chat-Gpt to convert the text to little and big endian.  
    here as a example how its looks like :
    - TEXT : `cercd`
    - LITTLE ENDIAN : `6463726563`
    - BIG ENDIAN : `6365726364`
    - also it can be shows as a `7A676B6F7A`. so don't worry
- after submit you go your flag.   
    <br/>HAPPY HUNTING...........!
