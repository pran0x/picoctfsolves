This pico-CTF is pretty much tuff you are not use to at git.  
to complete this CTF , first know about ==`git init,commit,branch,add,merge`.==

- First download the file and open the hidden `./git` file and open the `head`. here a `ref`shared, Go to that directory.
    
- Here we can see the username `picoxyz` and email `xyz@ctf` given  and a ==hash-type== text also, its your ==commit ID==. it's looks like this :
    
    <span style="color: #000000;">==e720dc26a1a55405fbdf4d338d465335c439fb3e==</span>
    
- now come back to ./git file. and type <span style="color: #2dc26b;">git config --global user.email "&lt;email we have got&gt;"</span>
    
- also <span style="color: #2dc26b;">git config --global user.name "&lt;username we got we have got&gt;"</span>
    
- now type `git init`. you show a message like this git ==reinitialized.==
    
- type `git log` . you must be show this type of message :
    
- ```git
